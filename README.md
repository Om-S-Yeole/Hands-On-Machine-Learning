# Hands-On Machine Learning

Welcome to the Hands-On Machine Learning project! This repository contains various resources, code examples, and exercises to help you learn and apply machine learning concepts.


## Introduction
Machine learning is a field of artificial intelligence that uses statistical techniques to give computer systems the ability to learn from data, without being explicitly programmed. This project aims to provide practical experience with machine learning algorithms and tools.
